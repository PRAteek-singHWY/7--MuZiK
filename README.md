1.Description ---> A web-based music application that enables users to search and play songs by top artists, listen to trending top hits, and explore related songs to a specific track.

2.My Experience and Problems Faced ---> During the development of this project, I encountered a challenge with the API. The API used in the tutorial was no longer available for free, so I had to find a suitable alternative using Rapid API . It was my first time working with a REST API, so I had to familiarize myself with the API structure and understand how to use the different API endpoints effectively. Despite the initial hurdle, I was able to create a better version of my application and gained valuable experience in working with API endpoints. Throughout the development process, the use of { console.log() } and { Chat-GPT's asistance }played crucial roles in my learning journey.
